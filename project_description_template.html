                <strong>Project Assignments</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Project Assignments give you a chance to put all of your recently learned skills to use by processing real data sets in order to generate new insights. Real data is messy and a big part of the Data Science workflow involves preparing data for analysis. Although the data sets you will work with are not that messy, you can expect to do a little cleaning up, organizing, and planning before you can perform your analysis. Similar to the Homework Assignments, the auto-graders in these notebooks are just in place to help you make sure you have your solutions in the right format. Your instructor, TA, tutors, etc. are here to help you with both your answers to the coding questions and open-response questions, but you will find that we will try to provide you with hints and guidance rather than answers.

                Once you are finished, you will need to complete the instructions near the bottom of the notebook to download an IPYNB file to submit to this Assignment page.
           </li>
            <li>
                When you are ready to submit the project, click the Start Assignment button on this Canvas Assignment page and upload the IPYNB file that you downloaded.

        </h3>
        <p>
            We will score your submitted work within 48 hours of the posted Available Until date based on the attached rubric.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There is a progress check component to the grade. Make sure to submit your project showing that you've attempted everything up to a specified point in the rubric by the posted deadline in the Canvas Calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your response to each coding question will be evaluated using a collection of auto-grader tests Note that some of the tests are hidden. Partial credit is possible on the coding questions, but the amount of partial credit depends on the number of auto-grader tests and how many you pass.</li>
            <li>
                The correctness of the open-response questions is subject to our interpretation of your response.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Work submitted after the Due date and before the Available Until date will be marked as LATE by Canvas. This marking is done automatically by Canvas, and it will not impact your grade.
