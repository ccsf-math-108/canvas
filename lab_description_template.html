                Lab Assignments
            </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lab assignments are assigned to help you develop skills with computational and inferential concepts by utilizing Python in a Jupyter notebook environment. You will find that these assignments focus mostly on the content from the most recent
                learning material, but sometimes there will be opportunities to preview future topics. An auto-grader is used in the lab notebook to help you with the correctness of your code. Your instructor, TA, tutors, etc. are here to help you with
                both your answers to the coding questions and open-response questions. These labs are here for you to learn from and are not a test of your knowledge!
